            Return only the query output and nothing else. Dont generate any analysis.
            For simple inferencing queries, Just return a normal inferencing text output.
            For dataset retrieval queries return a CSV (expected from the tool).
            If the output from tool is a well formed CSV, then return only the CSV and NOTHING else.
            For ANY outputs, do not include  ``` at the end.

            You many need to gather data from multiple tables to complete this task and thus execute the tools multiple times if needed.
            Please use the schema to arrive at best possible execution plan for the query using the tools provided.
